## Development Approach

This project was developed using **AI-assisted programming** with Claude AI integrated into VS Code terminal. The entire development process—from initial setup to feature implementation and debugging—was accomplished through natural language prompts.

**Key aspects of AI-assisted development used:**
- Component architecture and file structure
- Audio player implementation
- Search functionality
- Theme toggle system
- Bug identification and resolution

This approach demonstrates how AI tools can accelerate development workflows while maintaining code quality and best practices.
